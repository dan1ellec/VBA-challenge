# VBA Challenge - The VBA of Wall Street


## Task

To use VBA scripting to analyse stock market data. 

## Breakdown

* Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information.
    * The ticker symbol.
    * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    * The total stock volume of the stock.
    * The stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

* Conditional formatting highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The VBA script allows it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running it once.
